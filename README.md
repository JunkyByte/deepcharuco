# deepcharuco

Unofficial pytorch (lightning) implementation of the model proposed by Hu et al. in their paper [Deep ChArUco: Dark ChArUco Marker Pose Estimation CVPR2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03247) for ChArUco board localization.
This is a personal project and I have no affiliation with the authors, the results obtained might differ and should not be considered a reference of the paper results. All the data used by the paper is not public and therefore a fair comparison is impossible.

Some implementation details were not thoroughly discussed in the paper and I did my best to obtain comparable results using a similar model architecture and training procedure. I trained both the deep charuco and refinenet models on synthetic data generated on the fly. To train COCO images are required, 
further details in training section.

  Top our method, Bottom `cv2.aruco` for comparison.  
  The results are good even with blurry / low light settings while `cv2.aruco` does not find a single marker.

## Overview

### Architecture
![architecture](https://i.imgur.com/W8TnGgm.png)
The idea is to build a network which can localize charuco inner corners and recognize the ids of the corners found. The trained network is fit on a particular board configuration, in the case of the paper the board has `12` aruco markers for a total of 16 inner corners ([board image](src/reference/board_image_240x240.jpg)).
The network is divided into two parts, what we call `DeepCharuco` which is a fully convolutional network for localization and identification [net.py](src/models/net.py) and `RefineNet` another fully convolutional network for corner refinement [refinenet.py](src/models/refinenet.py). Refer to the paper for details.  

`DeepCharuco` takes a `(1, H, W)` grayscale image and outputs 2 tensors:
- loc: `(65, H/8, W/8)` representing the probability that a corner is in a particular pixel (`64` pixels for a `8x8` region + 1 dust bin channel)
- ids: `(17, H/8, W/8)` representing the probability that a certain `8x8` region contains a particular corner id + 1 dust bin channel.
`RefineNet` takes a `(1, 24, 24)` patch around a corner and outputs a `(1, 64, 64)` tensor representing the probability that the corner is in a certain (sub-)pixel in `8x` resolution of the central `8x8` region of the patch.  

### Benchmarks (inference)
Running on GTX1080Ti GPU, inference on a single `320x240` image stored on RAM (so there's also data transfer to gpu) and all `16` keypoints found (maximum computation case for RefineNet)
- DeepCharuco + Refinenet: `~192.5 fps`
- DeepCharuco (only): `~359 fps`

## Setup for training (and inference on val data)
`requirements.txt` should contain a valid list of requirements, notice `opencv-contrib` is `<4.7`.  
If you wan to run `inference.py` or the `data.py` and `data_refinenet.py` you will need to install [gridwindow](https://github.com/JunkyByte/python-gridwindow) which is used for visualization (or replace everything with normal `cv2` windows)

COCO images and annotations are needed for training (the label used just needs to contain images informations, I use `captions_*.json`).
To download coco images and labels refer to (https://cocodataset.org/#download) or use the following
```
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip

unzip train2017.zip
unzip val2017.zip
unzip annotations_trainval2017.zip
```
If you just want to run inference on COCO validation you can download only the `val2017` images and annotations.  

To specify the paths used and other configurations we use a `yaml` config file.
By default the scripts will try to load `src/config.yaml`. There's a `demo_config.yaml` that you can copy, the parameters are the following:
```yaml
input_size: [320, 240]  # Input images size used for training (width, height)
bs_train: 32  # batch size for deep charuco
bs_train_rn: 64  # batch size for refinenet
bs_val: 64  # batch size for deep charuco in validation
bs_val_rn: 128  # batch size for refinenet in validation
num_workers: 6  # num of workers used by dataloader in training
train_labels: 'coco/annotations/captions_train2017.json'  # training labels
val_labels: 'coco/annotations/captions_val2017.json'  # validation labels
val_images: 'coco/val2017/'  # training images
train_images: 'coco/train2017/'  # validation images
```

## Inference
The inference uses pytorch lightning ckpts similarly to training. You can extract the `nn.Module` if you want to drop the library and use pure pytorch. This should be straightforward, check pytorch lightning documentation about inference.

The pretrained models are in `src/reference/`:  
For `DeepCharuco` you can find `longrun-epoch=99-step=369700.ckpt`
<details>
  <summary>Training details + plots</summary>
  
  Training time: `27 hours on GTX1080ti`  
  batch size: `32`  
  lr: `5e-3`  
  negative probability (in [transformations.py](src/transformations.py)): 0.05  
  Training plots:
  ![train_res](https://i.imgur.com/PFTL10P.png)
  ![train_res2](https://i.imgur.com/pdrC5C4.png)
  
  Where `l2_pixels` is the euclidean distance in pixels of the corners the model found during validation and
  `match_ratio` is the percentage of corners found over the total in each image. Please look at [metrics.py](src/models/metrics.py),
  they are not perfect metrics but provide useful insights of the model training.
</details>

For `RefineNet` you can find `second-refinenet-epoch-100-step=373k.ckpt`
<details>
  <summary>Training details + plots</summary>
  
  Training time: `22 hours on GTX1080ti`  
  total: `8` which means we take 8 corners from each single sample image for training ([train_refinenet.py](src/train_refinenet.py))  
  batch size: `256` (virtually `32` because `batch_size // total` is used)  
  lr: `1e-4`  
  negative probability (in `transformations.py`): 0.05  
  Training plots:
  ![train_res](https://i.imgur.com/5ddmaEB.png)
  ![train_res2](https://i.imgur.com/7kLH046.png)
  
  Where `val_dist_refinenet_pixels` is the euclidean distance in pixels of the predicted corner in `8x` resolution (so if dist_pixels is `3` the error in original resolution is `3/8` of a pixel).
  Please look at [metrics.py](src/models/metrics.py) for details.

If you setup the val data you can run `inference.py` for a preview of results on validation data used in training. To do inference on your images check `inference.py` code and adapt it to your needs, the idea is the following:
```python
import cv2
from inference import infer_image, load_models

# Load models
deepc_path = './reference/longrun-epoch=99-step=369700.ckpt'
refinenet_path = './reference/second-refinenet-epoch-100-step=373k.ckpt'
n_ids = 16  # The number of corners (models pretrained use 16 for default board)
deepc, refinenet = load_models(deepc_path, refinenet_path, n_ids, device="cuda")  # use device: cpu / cuda

# Run inference on BGR image
img = cv2.imread('reference/samples_test/IMG_7412.png')

# The out_img will have corners plotted on it if draw_pred is True
# The keypoints format is (x, y, id_corner)
keypoints, out_img = infer_image(img, n_ids, deepc, refinenet, draw_pred=True)
```

Now that we obtained the keypoints we can use a PnP algorithm to recover the board pose as follows:  
For more infos check [pose_estimation.py](src/pose_estimation.py) which has been used to generate video previews of samples.

```python
from inference import solve_pnp

# load your intrinsics as camera_matrix and dist_coeffs
# check calib_intrinsics for a reference how I generated them.
# Check the solve pnp function and adapt it to your needs.
ret, rvec, tvec = solve_pnp(keypoints, col_count, row_count, square_len,
                            camera_matrix, dist_coeffs)
```

## Training
Setup `config.yaml` and run `train.py` and `train_refinenet.py` to train each network separately.

## Notes and Common issues
I do not have the intention to create a package out of this so I had to use some workarounds with imports. In the current state `numba` caching might break causing an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'model_utils'`. You just need to delete `src/__pycache__ and src/models/__pycache__` and everything will work fine.  

Most of the documentation for simple functions has been written using ChatGPT so it might contain errors.. what doesn't?  
The starting script for model architecture has been taken from a pytorch implementation of SuperPoint
